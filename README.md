### Description
This is just a collection of .NET exercises I have done and also some quick notes I have written. 


### Cheatsheet

To create a new console app:
`dotnet new console -o myApp`

Note that -o flag indicates in what folder the app is going to be created, and the console refers to the console app template. To see more options type:

`dotnet new --help`

Remember to import `System.Collections.Generic` if List are going to be implemented in the program:
```C#
using System.Collections.Generic;
```
